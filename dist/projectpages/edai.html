						analytics counterpart for teachers in 2 months</h2>

					<p>I was hired as the first designer to develop the designs in an iterative manner that can be used by the developers in 2 months. When I arrived, there were 2 developers, CEO, and CTO. The startup had just assembled a team and it was very small. There was a minimal prototype that the company had already developed with a basic response system for students and a real-time analytics interface for teachers for a competition at Antler.</p>
					<p>Schools have been using several tools to manage administrative work. EdAider wanted to bridge the gap with a single tool and robust analytics. EdAider needed designs that would cater to children in a playful way as well as to the teachers in a professional way.</p>

					<p>EdAider had been working with a team of researchers at Stockholm University in the learning analytics team. The CEO is a professor at Stockholm University. Hence, I did not conduct any big user study at this point. Instead, I decided to use the University research data and rely on a Facebook feedback group that we had set up for teachers to interact with.

					<ul class="mb-4">
						<li>Students need different	categories of responses namely knowledge, motivation, engagement and health to register what they feel during a class</li>

					<p>While we always look for competitors as companies, often the major competitor is something more simple and hidden. <strong>An example is that water is the major competitor of Cola.</strong> Yes, Cola needed to overcome water's thirst-quenching ability to make it successful.
					</p>

					<p class="mb-4">This is why for EdAider, the major competitor in the old practices in schools itself. Teachers can ask students whether they understood things, are motivated or focused, and get responses. A big part of education is still reliant on these manual methods and could create resistance to automated solutions. <strong>Often, there is also a psychological effect at play that a machine program cannot be better than a human in judgments related to education (from Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman)</strong>. It could lead to resisting new products.

						<li>Emojis for engaging experience based on the user testing feedback</li>
						<li>It allowed for more screen space for the chat as we wanted students to use the chat as much as possible</li>
						<li>All the categories and their respective responses were taken from the research results of SU researchers</li>
						<li>Emoji were combined with text because emojis can be a bit ambiguous at times and younger kids may not know the meaning of all emojis. The text makes it clearer</li>
						<li>We added more responses which were highlighted by teachers via a Facebook feedback group. They outlined the need for having help, raising hands, and temperature. <strong>Help</strong> is used when students needed help with a specific query. <strong>Raise hands</strong> is used for any general query by the teacher. Or in cases where the teacher asks questions and lets students raise hands and then choose one among them. Health category was removed for the moment as it was deemed "not very useful" by teachers</li>
						<li>Tabs were removed as the quiz and exam were decided to be pushed by the teacher directly during the class and students would receive it on their screen in real-time. But they would be able to view results when the lecture ends</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Three column format that would work for classroom as well as distance lectures</li>
						<li>Column 1: Housed the lecture information, livestream and materials. In case, of classroom lecture, livestream section would be invisible</li>
						<li>Column 2: The main viewarea for the livestream and lecture materials</li>
						<li>Column 3: The response system. It was deemed to be important to have all times during a lecture. Hence, we decided to keep it upfront</li>
						<li>Column 3: The chat could be toggled from the icon on the bottom right. We made a decision to first have tabs for response and chat but later decided on a chat icon as it was not being a lot and taking up a lot of interface real estate</li>

						<li>Chat conversations could be disabled/enabled as per need and also searchable</li>
						<li>The counters at the top for "Help Needed", "Raising hands" basically tell a student has a problem and the teacher can click the tag to make it disappear once the problem is solved</li>
						<li>Out of Focus: This counter gets triggered if a student is on another tab than EdAider. It is red for distracted students and goes grey if a student comes back to EdAider. The count shows how many times the student was out of focus</li>
