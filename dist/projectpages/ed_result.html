					<p>Teachers in Swedish schools have been using assessments like quizzes, exams, exit tickets, daily screenings, lesson evaluations to measure student learning and their wellbeing. Most times it is physical paper-based or through a tool like Google Forms.</p>
					<p>Often, it is messy and difficult to keep track of these assessments for each lecture in the long run and teachers spend a lot of time analyzing the results.</p>

					<p>EdAI team has been working with a team of learning analytics researchers at Stockholm University. We had prior information that teachers expressed interest in a digital assessment system with a variety of assessments.
 
					</p>

					<p>Once the pilot version with the response system was built, we did a workshop demonstration to observe the usage. The workshop also served as the user research platform about assessments and visualization of results from the teachers.
					</p>

					<h5 class="mb-4">Assessment definitions</h5>
					<ul class="mb-4">
						<li>Single Questions: These are one-time pushed during a lecture related to the current concept.</li>
						<li>Quizzes/Exams: Series of questions for weekly or monthly testing. Exams are graded while quizzes may or may not graded.</li>
						<li>Exit Ticket: A short questionnaire at the end of the lecture to understand the student's learning during that lecture.</li>
						<li>Daily Screenings: These include questions related to wellbeing and are given once in the morning and once at the end of the day.</li>
						<li>Lesson Evaluation: Mapping the student's level of understanding in a lesson rather than right or wrong answers.</li>
					</ul>

						<div class="col-lg-6">
							<h4 class="insights">Need for assessments especially exit ticket and daily screenings at least in the starting</h4>
							<h4 class="insights">A way to create assessments and keep track of them in a central location</h4>

						</div>

						<div class="col-lg-6">

The students themselves may feel less motivated since they mastered a concept already. Probably, an adaptive learning system would be beneficial for everyone. But it is an idea for the near future.</blockquote>

					<p class="mb-4">For this project, the major competitor would be the <strong>physical paper assessments</strong> that are still relevant and used a lot in schools. But they are cumbersome to maintain and the results have to be manually added to a system. There is a chance to replace them easily and this is why we see the rise of many online quiz platforms.

						<li>Three column format that would work for classroom as well as distance lectures</li>
						<li>Column 1: Housed the lecture information, livestream and materials. In case, of classroom lecture, livestream section would be invisible</li>
						<li>Column 2: The main viewarea for the livestream and lecture materials</li>
						<li>Column 3: The response system. It was deemed to be important to have all times during a lecture. Hence, we decided to keep it upfront</li>
						<li>Column 3: The chat could be toggled from the icon on the bottom right. We made a decision to first have tabs for response and chat but later decided on a chat icon as it was not being a lot and taking up a lot of interface real estate</li>

						<li>Chat conversations could be disabled/enabled as per need and also searchable</li>
						<li>The counters at the top for "Help Needed", "Raising hands" basically tell a student has a problem and the teacher can click the tag to make it disappear once the problem is solved</li>
						<li>Out of Focus: This counter gets triggered if a student is on another tab than EdAider. It is red for distracted students and goes grey if a student comes back to EdAider. The count shows how many times the student was out of focus</li>
